# Finally you decided to start using PomoDone App. Cheers!
## Step 1. Mandatory. 

Create an account. You can do it from the app, this very [website](https://pomodoneapp.com), [web app](https://app.pomodoneapp.com) or [profile](https://my.pomodoneapp.com) page, it doesn't matter. Just create an account! 

>Why do I need an account? I just want a timer!<br>Well, we need to know it's you. To show you **your** [precious log](https://my.pomodoneapp.com/log/). To connect your accounts and get your data from there. 


You'll receive an email with confirmation link (don't forget to check your junk mail folder). Click to the link to confirm the account. The page you'll get will ask you to create your password and define your Time Zone. It will take less than a minute. 


## Step 2. Kinda mandatory 

[Download](https://pomodoneapp.com/download-pomodone-app.html), install, launch your desktop app and log in there using your credentials, created on #1 of this list (or log in to the [web app](https://app.pomodoneapp.com) instead). 

You're all set. 

If you're fan of paper based task-lists or not sure what is your most beloved task management system yet, jump to the Step #5 of this instruction. 

## Step 3. Optional, but recommended 

If you're about to use your existing task management system, log in to [your profile page](https://my.pomodoneapp.com/). Let's connect it, clicking the icon of your task/note/event/project management system: Trello, Wunderlist, Todoist, Evernote, Google Calendar, Microsoft To-Do, Toodledo.

> We consider these systems as personal use systems, so it's available on any plan. Corporate/team type of systems (Asana, JIRA, Basecamps, MS Outlook Tasks) integrations are available for [Premium Plan](https://pomodoneapp.com/pricing-2017.html) users. You can either upgrade your account [here](https://pomodoneapp.com/pricing-2017.html) or [contact us](https://pomodoneapp.com/feedback.html) to get a free trial of the Ultimate plan. 


As soon as you connected the external system, let's fine tune the integration. Click its title in the [connected services list](https://my.pomodoneapp.com/account/). 
Select which projects, boards, calendars and notebooks you'd like to track time using PomoDone App. Drag'n'drop these projects to the right hand side column and save the settings. More than enough to start.

## Step 4. Let's dance? 

Open the app (or web app), and make a full sync. 
>CMD+S on macOS, CTRL+S on Windows or burger menu &rarr; sync all).<br>We advise to make full sync any time you change your connected sources structure (adding/removing the integration, changing the projects sync list etc). 

Ok, so we have all our tasks here in PomoDone now. If you prefer narrow app window, click to the Project Title (or blue arrow next to it) to switch between the projects. Or resize the app wide enough to see all your projects in the left hand side sidebar.

Let's choose the task and start working on it. You can either click pre-defined timers at the end of each row to start the timer immediately, or click the task title to get the timer screen. 

![Let's track time!](https://pomodoneapp.com/assets/images/blog/pd-screens-start.png) 

Click Play button to start the timer. 

>While the timer is ticking, focus on your task until the timer is finished, or until the task is done. All other buttons and links are hidden now, while the timer is ticking, so just focus.<br>You can switch between the tasks within the timer by clicking the Switch button:<br>![How to Swith](https://pomodoneapp.com/assets/images/blog/PD-switch-on-timer.png). 


You can get back to your task list clicking to the left arrow next to the task's title. 

##Step 5. Some tips and tricks. 

We created pre-filled Local Project dummy tasks to let you play with the PomoDone App. Don't hesitate to ignore these tasks (or even delete), or to use it for initial practice. 

To create your own task, just use **+** icon at the top, or CMD+N / CTRL+N hotkeys. Tasks Title and Project/List are mandatory (to let us keep your time tracking organized). Everything else is optional. 

>If you purchased App Store/Win Store version (or use any [Premium Plan](https://pomodoneapp.com/pricing-2017.html)), you can create your Local projects right in the app. Click the pen icon next to the Project Name.<br><br>![Manage Local Projects](https://pomodoneapp.com/assets/images/blog/PD-manage-local-projects.png)
